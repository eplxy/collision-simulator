# Collision Simulator

## Project Description

---
This project is the creation of a simulation tool depicting the physical concept known as
elastic collisions. The goal was to visually represent the different parameters affecting collisions
covered in college-level physics, specifically mechanics.

The created JavaFX Application allows users to simulate elastic collisions in a
2-dimensional space using circular colliding objects. Each object, as well as each simulation
instance has adjustable parameters which grant the user the ability to customize and fine tune
their desired visualization through JavaFX graphical UI controls.

## List of implemented features

- Animation & Physics Engine
- Collision parameters
    - velocity/speed
    - direction
    - friction (in percentage)
    - size (scaled to mass or can be chosen)
    - mass
    - position
    - number of objects
    - image on the object
- Sound effects
- Locally storing parameters
- Visual vectors
- Data visualization (numerical form)
- Preset situations/additional simulations
